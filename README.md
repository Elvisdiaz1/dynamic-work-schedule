# Work Schedule

## Description

This project was built for the purposes of creating a work schedule with a dynamic feature of having the current time and date as well as local storage to save any notes you write down for a certain time period. The dynamic time and date was built using the Dayjs library. This solves the problem of having to keep track of the time and date of your notes manualy and instead allows the device to keep track for you. This project helped me to learn how to use jquery, Dayjs, and third party apis in general.

## Installation

To install this project, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine and you can open the index.html in your browser by right clicking the html in the directory and choosing which browser to open it in.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

There is not much you need to do to use this project as it is a application that simply tracks your date and time. However, if you want to write and save notes for a certain time period, then you need to go to the hourly time period you want to write notes in, write your notes in the text box, and click on the save icon to the right of the respective text box. Then your notes will be saved and you can view them whenever you view the page.
